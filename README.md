# Idea
It's a color game for kids! We used the tracking.js library, the Unsplash API and the GIPHY API to create a fun game of guessing the right color. A user is shown an image with a distinct color, and then asked to find an object with a matching color and then show it to the camera.

# User Guide

Here's how it works:

- You have an initial form where you must type in a name and then hit the submit button. There is an instructions handle that is visible on the left side of the screen.
- When you click submit, the page will hide the input form and submit button, and then display the name entered on the navbar. Then, the page will show three buttons:  Play, Pause, Reset. Play will be pulsing.
- Click on the Play button. If its a user's first time, then the page will ask to enable the camera of the user. Then, a 30-second countdown will display as well as the color the user needs to match.
- Find an object with a similar color. Show it to the camera. Use the live video feed as a reference of what the camera is capturing. 
- When an object matches, the site will pop up a modal that determins a win or loss. The page will keep track of # of wins.
- There are 5 colors to match.
- Have fun!

P.S. a chat box is available to use to chat with other players. *Not enabled in V1*.
